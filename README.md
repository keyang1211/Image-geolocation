In: *European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)*, Munich, Springer, 2018, 575-592.

## News

**12th December 2020 - [*PyTorch*](#Pytorch-Implementation) version:** 
We release a PyTorch implementation and provide weights of a pre-trained `base(M, f*)` model with underlying ResNet50 architecture.

**17th February 2020 - [*original_tf*](https://github.com/TIBHannover/GeoEstimation/tree/original_tf) branch:** 
Since our code is not compatible with TensorFlow 2 and relies on a Caffe model for scene classification, we have added a Dockerfile to simplify the installation. In addition, we have modified the inference script. It is now able to automatically generate the reported results in the paper for the testing datasets.


## Contents

- [Web Demo](#Demo) 
- [Reproduce Paper Results](#Reproduce-Paper-Results): A seperate branch (*original_tf*() where all information and pre-trained models are provided to reproduce the original results of the paper.
- [PyTorch Implementation](#PyTorch-Implementation): A re-implemented version of the `base(M, f*)` model in PyTorch including code for training, validation, testing, and inference.

## Demo
A graphical demonstration where you can compete against the deep learning approach presented in the publication can be found on: https://labs.tib.eu/geoestimation

This demo additionally supports uploading and analyzing your own images. A simplified offline version is located in this repository: https://tibhannover.github.io/GeoEstimation/



## Reproduce Paper Results 
We provide the original TensorFlow 1.14 implementation based on a ResNet101 to reproduce the results reported in the paper in the [*original_tf*](https://github.com/TIBHannover/GeoEstimation/tree/original_tf) branch.

## PyTorch Implementation
We have updated our code in PyTorch including scripts for training, inference and test. We have retrained the `base(M, f*)` model using a ResNet50 architecture and it achieved comparable results despite its lower complexity.

```
mkdir -p models/base_M
wget https://github.com/TIBHannover/GeoEstimation/releases/download/pytorch/epoch.014-val_loss.18.4833.ckpt -O models/base_M/epoch=014-val_loss=18.4833.ckpt
wget https://github.com/TIBHannover/GeoEstimation/releases/download/pytorch/hparams.yaml -O models/base_M/hparams.yaml

### Reproduce Results

#### Test on Already Trained Model
The (list of) image files for testing can be found on the following links:
* Im2GPS: http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/im2gps/ (can be downloaded automatically)
* Im2GPS3k: https://github.com/lugiavn/revisiting-im2gps/

Download and extract the two testsets (Im2GPS, Im2GPS3k) in `resources/images/<dataset_name>` and run the evaluation script with the provided meta data, i.e., the ground-truth coordinate for each image.
When using the default paramters, make sure that the pre-trained model is available. 
```bash
# download im2gps testset
mkdir resources/images/im2gps

Results on the Im2GPS and Im2GPS3k test sets: The reported accuracies (in percentage) is the fraction of images localized within the given radius (in km) using the GCD distance. Note, that we used the full MP-16 training dataset and all 25600 images for validation, thus the results will differ when not all images are available.

#### Training from Scratch
We provide a complete training script which is written in [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) and report all hyper-paramters used for the provided model. Furthermore, a script is given to download and pre-process the images that are used for training and validiation.

1) Download training and validation images
    - We provide a script to download the images given a list of URLs
    - Due to no longer publicly available images, the size of the dataset might be smaller than the original.
    - We also store the images in chunks using [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) to speed-up the training process (similar to multiple TFRecord files)
2) Given multiple s2 partitionings (e.g. coarse, middle, fine from the paper), the respective classes are assigned to each image on both datasets.
3) Training and hyper-paramters: All hyper-paramters can be configured in `configs/baseM.yml` as well as paramters from PyTorch Lightning [`Trainer`](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/trainer.html#trainer-class-api) class.


Necessary steps:
```bash
# download and preprocess images
wget https://github.com/TIBHannover/GeoEstimation/releases/download/v1.0/mp16_urls.csv -O resources/mp16_urls.csv
wget https://github.com/TIBHannover/GeoEstimation/releases/download/pytorch/yfcc25600_urls.csv -O resources/yfcc25600_urls.csv

### Geographical S2 Cell Partitioning

The geographical cell labels are extracted using the [*S2 geometry library*](https://code.google.com/archive/p/s2-geometry-library/) and can be visualized on http://s2.sidewalklabs.com/regioncoverer/.
Create a partitioning using the following command for a given dataset (as *CSV* file) which contains an image id, latitude and longitude.
We provide the partitionings that are used in the paper [below](#Requirements).
```shell script
python partitioning/create_cells.py [-h] [-v] --dataset DATASET --output OUTPUT --img_min IMG_MIN --img_max IMG_MAX [--lvl_min LVL_MIN]
                       [--lvl_max LVL_MAX]
# Optional arguments:
#   -h, --help         show this help message and exit
#   -v, --verbose      verbose output
#   --dataset DATASET  Path to dataset csv file
#   --output OUTPUT    Path to output directory
#   --img_min IMG_MIN  Minimum number of images per geographical cell
#   --img_max IMG_MAX  Maximum number of images per geographical cell
#   --lvl_min LVL_MIN  Minimum partitioning level (default = 2)
#   --lvl_max LVL_MAX  Maximum partitioning level (default = 30)
#   --column_img_path  CSV input column name for image id / path
#   --column_lat       CSV input column name latitude
#   --column_lng       CSV input column name longitude
```
